  Assured Sentinel implements probabilistic guardrails for AI-generated code
  using Conformal Prediction to provide distribution-free, finite-sample
  statistical guarantees on unsafe code acceptance rates. The system combines
  deterministic SAST scoring (via Bandit) with calibrated thresholds to bound
  the probability of accepting vulnerable code at a user-specified risk
  tolerance level α.
