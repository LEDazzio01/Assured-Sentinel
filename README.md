# 🛡️ Assured Sentinel
**Probabilistic Guardrails for Generative Code**

---

## 🚀 The Mission
The rapid ascendancy of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a profound challenge: the inherent uncertainty of probabilistic outputs. While LLMs accelerate development, they cannot inherently quantify the risk of the code they generate.

**Assured Sentinel** bridges the gap between stochastic generation and deterministic safety. It is not merely a linter; it is a system that imposes mathematical safety guarantees on generative models using **Split Conformal Prediction (SCP).**

---

## 🏛️ Architectural Overview
The system employs a **Two‑Agent Pattern** to decouple generation from verification, preventing the self‑delusion common in single‑agent loops.

### 🧠 The Analyst (Generator)
- **Role:** The stochastic motor  
- **Behavior:** High‑temperature (0.8), high‑entropy generation  
- **Objective:** Propose creative solutions to user queries  
- **Stack:** Azure OpenAI (gpt‑4o) via Semantic Kernel  

### 🛡️ The Commander (Guardrail)
- **Role:** The deterministic logic gate  
- **Behavior:** Strictly procedural and statistical  
- **Mechanism:**  
  - Calculates a Non‑Conformity Score (Inverse Security Score) using static analysis (simulated or bandit).  
  - Compares against a pre‑calibrated threshold (\( \hat{q} \)).  
- **Guarantee:** Ensures accepted code meets a specific risk tolerance (\(1 - \alpha\)) with statistical validity.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+  
- Azure OpenAI API Key  

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/assured-sentinel.git
cd assured-sentinel
``` 

# Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory
```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

# Calibration (One‑Time Setup)

Run calibration to establish safety threshold (q_hat)
```
python calibration.py
```

Output: Generates calibration_data.pkl containing the calculated safety threshold based on (\alpha = 0.1).

# Run the Sentinel

Execute the main event loop
```
python run_day4.py
```

# 📐 Theoretical Framework

We strictly adhere to Split Conformal Prediction (SCP).

 - Calibration Set: A "Ground Truth" dataset (e.g., MBPP) establishes a baseline distribution of code scores.

 - Non‑Conformity Measure (NCM): A scoring function where 0.0 = Secure and 1.0 = Vulnerable.

# The Guarantee:

[ P(Y_{n+1} \in C(X_{n+1})) \geq 1 - \alpha ]

We target (\alpha = 0.1), providing 90% confidence that accepted code belongs to the set of secure outputs.

# 📊 Roadmap

 [x] Phase 1 – Build (MVP):

 - Implement Analyst/Commander MAS pattern

 - Implement NCM scoring logic

 - Establish calibration set with MBPP

[ ] Phase 2 – Validate:

 - Benchmark SCP thresholds across diverse datasets

 - Stress‑test against adversarial prompts

[ ] Phase 3 – Deploy:

 - Package as reproducible GitHub Codespace

 - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
